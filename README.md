# Text-Summarization-using-Topic-Modeling
Using the concept of text summarization, one can create a smaller or compact version of the original document without leaving any relevant and necessary information. This project aims to provide similar kind-off functionality. I have enforced topic modeling, that is a sort of applied math modeling for locating the abstract “topics” that occur within the source file. For this, I have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA-a type of topic model) to classify a particular topic.
